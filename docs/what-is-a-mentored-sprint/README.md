# Unlock Your Software’s Full Potential with Mentored Sprints

 Designed for teams looking to port their applications to modern hardware or optimize performance, our Mentored Sprints combine hands-on guidance, expert tools, and proven strategies to achieve rapid results.

## What Is a Mentored Sprint?
Our 5-day Mentored Sprint is an intensive, guided process designed to accelerate your software development goals. Whether you’re transitioning to new GPU hardware, optimizing existing code, or exploring new software tools, we’ll work side by side with your team to create a focused plan, execute it, and document actionable results.

The process starts three weeks before the sprint itself. During this preparation period, we:
- Secure access to shared development platforms hosting your target hardware.
- Set up robust build and testing environments.
- Collaborate to create a tailored sprint plan aligned with your broader goals.

Then comes Sprint Week: a 5-day, fast-paced effort where our mentors and your team tackle the agreed-upon goals. Through daily stand-ups and real-time coding sessions, we address challenges, adjust strategies, and deliver results. Finally, the journey concludes with a retrospective white paper, outlining achievements, hurdles overcome, lessons learned, and next steps.

## Real-World Results: Performance, Savings, and Sustainability
The outcomes speak for themselves. [In a recent Mentored Sprint](../saving-energy-on-quantum-chromodynamics-simulations/README.md), we optimized a customer’s application to achieve a **1.91x performance improvement** on AMD GPUs compared to the baseline. This wasn’t just about speed—it translated into significant **energy cost savings**, reducing runtime energy consumption by over **36.5% per iteration**. Over the course of millions of runs, these savings compound into substantial cost reductions and a greener operational footprint.

By the end of your sprint, you’ll not only see measurable improvements in your application’s performance but also gain the skills and insights to continue optimizing in the future.

## Why Choose a Mentored Sprint?
- **Expert Guidance:** Work directly with experienced mentors who bring deep expertise in GPU programming, HPC optimization, and software engineering.
- **Rapid Progress:** Compress months of work into a single week with a structured and hands-on approach.
- **Future-Proof Your Applications:** Learn the tools and strategies needed to adapt your software to modern hardware environments.
- **Tangible ROI:** Reduce energy costs, improve runtime performance, and set the foundation for ongoing savings.
