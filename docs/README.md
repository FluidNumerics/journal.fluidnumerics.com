In high-performance computing, optimizing GPU workloads isn’t just about speed—it’s about unlocking hidden savings in energy and sustainability. Discover how a 1.91x performance boost turned into real cost savings and why software optimization could transform your operations.

If you've read some of my other posts, you're aware I'm in the midst of refactoring and updating/upgrade SELF-Fluids. On the upgrade list, I'm planning a swap-out of the CUDA-Fortran implementation for HIP-Fortran, which will allow SELF-Fluids to run on both AMD and Nvidia GPU platforms. This journal entry details a portion of the work I've been doing to understand how some of the core routines in SELF-Fluids will perform across GPU platforms with HIP.
